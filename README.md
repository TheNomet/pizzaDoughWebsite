Professional pizza and dough calculator built with React, Vite, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and shadcn/ui.

## Development

git clone <REPO_URL>
cd dough-master-pro
npm install
npm run dev
```

Visit `http://localhost:5173` (or the port reported in the terminal) to preview changes.

## Build & Deploy

```sh
npm run build
```

The production build is emitted to `dist/` and can be deployed to any static hosting provider (Netlify, Vercel, Cloudflare Pages, S3, etc.). Make sure your domain points to the deployed build so that social previews use the new Open Graph metadata from `index.html`.

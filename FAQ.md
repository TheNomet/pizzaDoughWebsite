## Dough Calculator

### What types of dough are supported?
Pizza&Dough supports four main categories:

**Pizza:**

**Baking Tray:**

**Bread:**

**Sweet Dough:**

### How does the dough calculator work?
The calculator uses your inputs (flour type, hydration, salt, yeast, temperature, and timing) to calculate precise ingredient amounts. It supports multiple input modes:
- **Batch size**: Enter total dough weight or number of items
- **Tray baking**: Enter tray dimensions and thickness
- **Weight per item**: Specify individual item weight

The app automatically calculates all ingredient amounts based on baker's percentages and your specifications.

### Can I customize ingredient amounts?
Yes! Pizza&Dough allows you to:
- Adjust hydration, salt, and yeast percentages
- Add oil, fat, sugar, milk, and eggs
- Create custom ingredients with precise measurements
- Organize ingredients into subsections
- Fine-tune every aspect of your recipe

### What is the difference between different dough styles?
Each dough style has optimized defaults for:
- Hydration levels
- Fermentation times
- Yeast amounts
- Proofing schedules
- Kneading methods

These defaults are based on traditional techniques and can be customized to your preferences.

---

## Yeast Calculations

### What is Dref (Dough Rise Factor)?
Dref is a parameter that controls how much your dough should rise during fermentation. A higher Dref value means more rise (more yeast), while a lower value means less rise (less yeast). The default is 1.4, but you can adjust it to fine-tune your dough's behavior.

### Can I use different types of yeast?
Yes! Pizza&Dough supports three yeast types:
- **Dry yeast**: Most common, long shelf life
- **Fresh yeast**: Also called compressed or cake yeast
- **Instant yeast**: Fast-acting, no proofing needed

The app automatically converts between types, so you can use whichever you have available.

### How does temperature affect yeast calculations?
Temperature is crucial for yeast activity. Pizza&Dough calculates yeast amounts based on:
- **Room temperature (RT)**: For bulk fermentation and proofing
- **Cold temperature (CT)**: For cold fermentation in the refrigerator

The application will sum all the RT and CT steps and calculate the yeast accordingly.

### Why does my yeast amount change when I adjust timing?
Yeast amount is inversely related to fermentation time: more time = less yeast needed, less time = more yeast needed. When you adjust your fermentation schedule, Pizza&Dough automatically recalculates the optimal yeast amount to maintain consistent results.

## Pre-ferments

### What are pre-ferments?
Pre-ferments are portions of dough that are fermented separately before being mixed into the main dough. They develop flavor and improve dough structure. Pizza&Dough supports:
- **Poolish**: Liquid pre-ferment (100% hydration)
- **Biga**: Stiff pre-ferment (50-60% hydration)
- **Levain**: Sourdough starter-based pre-ferment
- **Sponge**: Similar to poolish, used in enriched doughs

### How do I use pre-ferments in Pizza&Dough?
1. Enable the pre-ferment option in the dough calculator
2. Select your pre-ferment type (poolish, biga, levain, or sponge)
3. Set the pre-ferment percentage (how much of your total flour goes into the pre-ferment)
4. The app automatically calculates:
   - Pre-ferment flour and water amounts
   - Pre-ferment yeast amount
   - Main dough ingredient adjustments
   - Fermentation schedule for both pre-ferment and main dough

### Can I customize pre-ferment hydration?
Yes! For poolish and biga, you can customize the hydration level. The app will adjust calculations accordingly. For levain, you can specify the active starter percentage.

### Does the app calculate the main dough yeast taking into account also pre-ferments?
Yes! When you use a pre-ferment, Pizza&Dough automatically adjusts the main dough yeast amount. Since the pre-ferment already contains yeast that will contribute to fermentation, the app reduces the yeast in the main dough accordingly. This ensures your dough ferments perfectly without overproofing, giving you balanced results every time.

### Can I set up autolyse when using a pre-ferment?
Yes! You can combine pre-ferments with autolyse:

1. Set up your pre-ferment as usual
2. In the main dough section, add an autolyse step
3. The autolyse automatically uses:
   - 100% of the main dough flour (flour not in the pre-ferment)
   - 50% of the main dough water
4. The remaining water is added later when mixing in the pre-ferment

This workflow combines the flavor benefits of pre-ferments with the gluten development benefits of autolyse.

## Baker's Percentage

### What is Baker's Percentage?
Baker's Percentage is a professional method of expressing recipe ingredients as percentages relative to the total flour weight. Flour is always 100%, and all other ingredients are expressed as percentages of that flour weight.

### How does the Baker's Percentage calculator work?
The calculator allows you to:
- Enter ingredient amounts and see percentages
- Enter percentages and see ingredient amounts
- Visualize the breakdown of your recipe
- Understand the relationship between ingredients

### Why is Baker's Percentage useful?
Baker's Percentage makes it easy to:
- Scale recipes up or down
- Compare different recipes

- Maintain consistency across batches
- Adjust recipes while keeping ratios correct

### Can I use Baker's Percentage with custom ingredients?
Yes! The calculator includes all standard ingredients (flour, water, salt, yeast, oil, fat, sugar, milk, eggs) and supports custom ingredients you've added to your recipes.

---

## Units & Measurements

### Can I use different units (metric/imperial)?
Yes! Pizza&Dough supports both metric and imperial units. You can switch between them in the settings:
- **Metric**: Grams, kilograms, liters, Celsius
- **Imperial**: Ounces, pounds, fluid ounces, Fahrenheit

All calculations automatically convert when you switch units.

### How accurate are the conversions?
Pizza&Dough uses precise conversion factors:
- 1 kg = 2.20462 lbs
- 1 g = 0.035274 oz
- Temperature conversions use standard formulas

## Advanced Features

### What are custom ingredients?
Custom ingredients allow you to add any ingredient to your recipe with precise measurements. Examples:
- Seeds (sesame, poppy, etc.)
- Herbs and spices
- Specialty flours
- Additives (malt, vitamin C, etc.)

Each custom ingredient can be specified as a percentage of flour or as an absolute amount.

### What are ingredient subsections?
Subsections help you organize complex recipes by grouping ingredients into logical sections. For example:
- **Main dough**: Flour, water, salt, yeast
- **Enrichments**: Oil, fat, sugar, milk, eggs
- **Add-ins**: Custom ingredients, seeds, etc.

To enable subsections, tap the three dots (⋯) menu next to the main dough section in the calculator. From there, you can add subsections to organize your ingredients. This makes it easier to understand and follow complex recipes.

### What is the kneading method setting?
The kneading method setting mainly changes the water temperature for mixing. Different kneading methods generate different amounts of friction heat:
- **Mixer**: Stand mixers generate more friction heat, so cooler water is used
- **Hand kneading**: Manual kneading generates less heat, so warmer water may be needed

The app automatically adjusts the water temperature based on your selected kneading method to help you achieve the desired final dough temperature.

### How do I use the temperature selector?
The temperature selector helps you:
- Set room temperature for bulk fermentation
- Set cold temperature for refrigerator fermentation
- See how temperature affects timing
- Optimize your fermentation schedule

The app uses these temperatures in yeast calculations and timing recommendations.

### What is the Dref adjustment?
Dref (Dough Rise Factor) controls how much your dough rises:
- **Higher Dref (1.5-2.5)**: More rise, more active fermentation
- **Lower Dref (1.2-1.3)**: Less rise, slower fermentation
- **Default (1.4)**: Balanced rise for most recipes

Adjust Dref to fine-tune your dough's behavior based on your preferences and conditions.
